# medDreamDocker
First at all you need to start docker as a service.
## Remove containers
```bash
./rm.sh
```

## Stop containers
```bash
./stop.sh
```

## Start containers
```bash
./start.sh
```
## Cat settings
After the first start you could run a cat settings command to store locally the settings.
```bash
./cat_settings.sh
```
Then change the files and start again.
